Moderator: Let's start with healthcare. What is your vision for healthcare reform?

Donald Trump (Example): "Under my administration, we delivered the largest tax cuts and deregulations, which fueled the economy. Healthcare costs went down. What we're going to do is keep healthcare affordable by making sure that competition is there, and by ensuring that people have choices. Biden's healthcare agenda is just about government control."

Kamala Harris (Example): "Healthcare is a right, not a privilege. We need to build on the Affordable Care Act and expand Medicare so that every American, regardless of their income, can get quality healthcare. Trump’s approach to healthcare has left millions without insurance, and it’s time we fix this."
